# Rainfall Prediction using LSTM
This repository contains Python program files developed for the prediction of one-month ahead rainfall employing LSTM network from hydrometeorological variables. It contains files for data processing, feature selection, model development, and result extraction.

The corresponding full paper "A Deep Learning Approach Using Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Enhanced Prediction of Rainfall in the Northeastern Region of Bangladesh" is now available in the conference proceedings: https://lnkd.in/dVwhy83Y
